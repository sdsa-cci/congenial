# TPNRD Water Data Program

Twin Platte Natural Resources District (TPNRD) has entered into an agreement with GiSC for collecting water use. GiSC is a producer owned data cooperative and is governed by a board of farmers. Together, TPNRD and its producers have partnered with GiSC to bring TPNRD Irrigated Growers a new Water Data Program. This program will be an evolving digital service that automates the collection of higher quality water usage data.
GiSCâ€™s digital platform will be the foundation of the Water Data Program, and will collect and store water usage data based on four key pieces of information:

- Your Acres
- Crops Planted
- Well Flow
- Hours of Pumping
- The expected outcome is a more accurate modeling of our water resources and that is to your advantage. TPNRD is committed to serving you by making sure we are utilizing the best data.

Along with the prospect of productivity gains in farming operations, the Water Data Program will also generate the data needed for the required ground water models utilized in the TPNRD Integrated Management Plan (IMP). The IMP is a required plan for the TPNRD to manage water over the next 10 years.
